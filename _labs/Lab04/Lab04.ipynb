    "\n",
    "What happens when you type a URL into the search bar? Well, you can follow along at [this in depth guide](https://github.com/alex/what-happens-when) which takes you through all the layers of the IP stack, tracing every bit of data exchange. However, for our purposes we just need to understand a few basics:\n",
    "1. When you hit `enter` on your web-browser, the browser issues a `GET` command to the webserver, asking for the default homepage, typically a page called `index.html`.\n",
    "2. The server then sends back either the contents of that page with a HTTP code `200`, meaning everything worked, or it sends back an error like `404`, meaning that you asked for a page it doesn't know how to find. You can read more about [HTTP Error codes here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes).\n",
    "3. Your browser then takes that page, perhaps issuing even more requests to other pages to grab content like rich media, and then puts all this together into an interactive display that you can use on your desktop.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, at a high level, our computer asks for something, and the web server sends it back to us!\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this demo we are going to work with the webpage for the [Data Science course at the University of Maryland by Prof. John P. Dickerson](http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/fall2018/cmsc320/). The course here at Tulane owes a big debt to John who helped us come up with much of the content for this course.\n",
    "\n",
