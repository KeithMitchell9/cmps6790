    "The sign of the covariance will match the direction of the relationship between the two variables. The figures below illustrate why. If two variables are positively related, then the scatterplot might look as follows, with most points in the upper-right and lower-left quadrants (when you divide up the plane into four quadrants based on the means of $X$ and $Y$).\n",

A point in the lower-left quadrant (where $x$ and $y$ are both less than their respective means) also has a positive contribution, since the product of two negative numbers is also positive. Therefore, on the whole, the covariance will be positive for two variables with a positive relationship.\n",

For example, the two variables below have _zero_ covariance because the negative contributions from the upper-left and lower-right quadrants perfectly cancel out the positive contributions from the upper-right and lower-left quadrants.

    "## Grammar of Graphics\n",
    "\n",
    "The **grammar of graphics** organizes the ideas above into a coherent philosophy. The key insight is that a graphic can be specified by mapping its \"aesthetics\" (e.g., color, size, $x$-axis, column facet) to variables in a data set. Although `pandas` provides some support for this philosophy (as we have seen above), the process is tedious and often requires writing boilerplate code. For example, in order to use color to represent building type, we had to manually map each building type to a color. Libraries based on the grammar of graphics provide a more friendly interface and hide this complexity from the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Software packages that implement the grammar of graphics include `ggplot2` in R and [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/) in Python. Since we are working in Python, we will use Altair. The first step is to import the package.  You will need to install this package on the data science docker image.  If you want go check them out for your final project.  [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) is another package we have discussed which allows for this."
