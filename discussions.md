Throughout the semester we will have a number of group discussions that ask you to respond to a reading or video as well as your fellow classmates. 

## Discussion 1 - Introductions and Interests

*Welcome!* This course brings together students from around the world with unique work, life, and educational experiences. You will get to engage and develop working relationships with many of these fellow students. This is your chance to learn a bit more about your peers.

*Update Your Canvas Profile* Make sure that your Canvas profile is up to date. To do this, select “Account”, then “Profile” on the menu bar. Here you can add an image, your contact details, bio, and links to other platforms such as LinkedIn.

*Introduce Yourself!* Record a short introductory video of 1–2 minutes. Use the following questions as a guideline for sharing more about yourself so that we can get to know you better:
1. Where do you currently reside (state or country)?
2. What is your professional background?
3. What is a hobby that you enjoy doing?
4. What are your long-term career goals?

*Upload Your Video and Respond!* 
* Ideally, upload your video as an MP4 file.
* To upload, click “Reply” below and then “Insert” on the toolbar.
* On the dropdown menu, select “Media” then “Upload/Record Media”.
* Once the file is uploaded, click the “Post” button. 
* To comment on someone else’s video, click “Reply” and use a hashtag and their name.

## Discussion 2 - Concrete Datasets and Proposals

As a means of kicking off a conversation and potentially teaming up for the tutorial, please write a few sentences for the following prompts.

1. List two datasets (with links) that you are interested in exploring for the final tutorial.
2. For each of these two datasets, give two concrete questions that you would be interested in exploring.

## Discussion 3 - Data Science Ethics Concerns

## Discussion 4 - Project Pitch Peer Feedback

## Discussion 5 - Final Tutorial Presentation Peer Feedback

## Discussion Grading Rubric (5 Points Each)

* (5 Points) *Discussion Responses*: In all discussions you are required to make a main post which responds to the prompt in a thoughtful way. These should, in general be shorter (about one paragraph, 80-150 words) and please do not drone on like ChatGPT, I will take points away for long and rambling posts. You have also posted at least 2 replies to your fellow students that are respectful and provide a point of discussion (i.e., not "nice job" or "ok").
