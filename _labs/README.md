# Labs

**To work on a Lab, you should:**
- Clone the course repository to your local machine and make sure you perform a git pull before working to make sure you have the most up to date lab.
- Move the lab file somewhere else in your filesystem, otherwise your work may be overwritten.
- Do the lab, and then when you're ready find the .ipynb file and upload the .ipynb file to the appropriate assignment in [Canvas](https://tulane.instructure.com/)


**A less preferred way to work on Labs follows, but you'll want to make sure you can do the above!**
- Click the corresponding `Open in Colab` link below.
- Immediately click `File->Save` (Command/Ctrl S), then "Save a Copy in Drive"
- This will create a new copy in the `Colab Notebooks` folder of your personal Google Drive for whichever Google account you are signed into at the time.
- Save the file regularly as you complete the assignment.
- When you're ready to submit your work:
  + Go to File->Download .ipynb
  + Upload the .ipynb file to the appropriate assignment in [Canvas](https://tulane.instructure.com/)

## Lab Grading (10 Points Each)

* (5 Points) *Professionalism*: You have written code that is interpretable â€“ it contains comments where needed to understand, variable names are reasonable, and code that is reasonable and efficient. You have followed directions to turn in the file, clearly labeling everything. You have cited all sources and how you used them in the written portion of your answers. There are no unused cells, there are no errors or other distractions.
* (5 Points) *Code and/or Written Answers*: Code: Code is present for all cells and code is correct and reasonable. Written answers are present for all cells where asked. Written answers are complete sentences and clear.

| Full    |    Good |  Okay   |  Lacking   |  No Marks |
