    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "MSE is difficult to interpret because its units are the square of the units of $y$. To make MSE more interpretable, it is common to take the _square root_ of the MSE to obtain the **root mean squared error** (or RMSE, for short):\n",

In general, we can split the data into $k$ subsamples, alternately training the data on $k-1$ subsamples and evaluating the model on the $1$ remaining subsample, i.e., the validation set. This produces $k$ somewhat independent estimates of the test error. This procedure is known as **$k$-fold cross validation**. (Be careful not to confuse the $k$ in $k$-fold cross validation with the $k$ in $k$-nearest neighbors.) Therefore, the specific version of cross validation that we saw earlier is $2$-fold cross validation.\n",

To be completely above board, we should standardize each training set with respect to the mean and SD of just that training set.\n",
